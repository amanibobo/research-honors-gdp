            Problem Statement
          </h1>
          <p className="text-zinc-700">
            A common, reoccurring theme at Innovation Academy is that students
            come to school late. Whether it is because of traffic, waking up
            late, or any other reason, checking into school late leads to
            students missing out on educational time. At IA, when students come
            late, they have to go to the front desk and check-in via a computer.
            Because many students often come late, a lot of them need to check
            in, thus causing lines for students to wait in.
          </p>

          <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-12">How Might We / Criteria of Success</h1>
          <p className="text-zinc-700 mb-6">
            How might we create a more efficient check-in System for late
            students to get to class faster at Innovation Academy? Our criteria
            of success includes: The check-in system created should be able to
            check in students within 15-20 seconds of arrival, The check in
            system must be able to take in an alternate form of ID, (this can be
            back-up qr codes sent to studentâ€™s emails), and Admins and teachers
            should be able to have the late check-ins on record. The check-in
            system using a qr/bar code scanner to pick up student ID codes to
            authorize the individual, send the tardiness notification to the
            admins and the teacher the student has when they come late. Our
            Procedure to get our product was changed throughout and used client
            feedback and iterations we had done.
